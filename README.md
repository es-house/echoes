# Echoes

**Echoes** is a 3D first-person puzzle prototype designed to explore non-verbal teaching, player expression, and temporal collaboration through ghost mechanics.

The player can **record their actions** and **replay them through a ghost**, using this mechanic to interact with the world and solve spatial puzzles. There are no tutorials, everything is learned through experimentation and design cues.

This prototype was built in about a week as part of my ongoing portfolio development in game design.

### üéÆ Core Features

* **Ghost Recording Mechanic** ‚Äì Record your actions and replay them as a ghost to solve time-based challenges.
* **Pressure Plate System** ‚Äì Interact with doors and objects by triggering multiple pressure plates, using ghost replays.
* **Non-Verbal Onboarding** ‚Äì Designed to teach mechanics and controls organically, without written or spoken tutorials.
* **Simple Visual Language** ‚Äì Clear shape and color design to guide and teach the player through the level.
* **Responsive UI** ‚Äì Action bar inspired by modern ARPGs, with input hints and feedback icons.
* **VFX & Audio Feedback** ‚Äì Visual effects and sound design provide feedback for key actions like recording, ghost replay, and puzzle activation.

### üß† Purpose

This prototype was developed to:

* Explore non-verbal communication and tutorial-less learning in gameplay
* Practice time-based puzzle design and player-Ghost collaboration
* Demonstrate systems thinking and player guidance without dialogue
* Enrich my portfolio with a conceptually-focused, design-first project

### üöÄ Made With

* Unity 6 (version 6000.0.40f1)
* C#
* Unity Particle System
